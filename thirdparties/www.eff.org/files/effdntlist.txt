! Title: EFF DNT Policy Whitelist
! Expires: 5 days
! Last Scanned: Sun Nov 13 03:04:18 PST 2016
!
! EFF generates this whitelist by scanning the Alexa top 
! 1 million to see if a compliant Do Not Track policy is 
! posted at /.well-known/dnt-policy.txt. EFF has no way 
! of verifying if the domain actually complies with the 
! policy. The whitelist is updated with each scan.
!
! Note that this filter list will only
! be effective if you enable the DNT=1
! header in your browser (Privacy Badger
! does this automatically).
!
! report problems, comments, requests to
! dnt-policy@eff.org
